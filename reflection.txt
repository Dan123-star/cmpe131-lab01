Based on this lab, using branches is a powerful and safe way for a team of software engineers to collaborate on a signle project
because it allows engineers to work independently without affecting other's progress and the main code. In this lab, team members 
can try and test new code in the seperate branch to make sure it works before merging to the main code.
